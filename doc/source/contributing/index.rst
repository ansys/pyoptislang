Overall guidance on contributing to a PyAnsys library appears in the
`Contributing <https://dev.docs.pyansys.com/how-to/contributing.html>`_ topic
in the *PyAnsys Developer's Guide*. Ensure that you are thoroughly familiar
with this guide before attempting to contribute to PyOptiSLang.

The following contribution information is specific to PyOptiSLang.

Clone the repository and install the package
--------------------------------------------
To clone the PyOptiSLang repository and install the latest PyOptiSLang
release in development mode, run this code:

.. code::

    git clone https://github.com/pyansys/pyoptislang
    cd pyoptislang
    pip install pip -U
    pip install -e .


Post issues
-----------
Use the `PyOptiSLang Issues <https://github.com/pyansys/pyoptislang/issues>`_
page to submit questions, report bugs, and request new features. When possible,
use these issue templates:

* Bug report template
* Feature request template

If your issue does not fit into one of these template categories, create your
own issue.

To reach the project support team, email `pyansys.core@ansys.com <pyansys.core@ansys.com>`_.

View documentation
-------------------
Documentation for the latest stable release of PyOptiSLang is hosted at
`PyOptiSLang Documentation <https://optislang.docs.pyansys.com>`_.

In the upper right corner of the documentation's title bar, there is an option
for switching from viewing the documentation for the latest stable release
to viewing the documentation for the development version or previously
released versions.

Adhere to code style
--------------------
PyOptiSLang follows the PEP8 standard as outlined in the `PyAnsys Development Guide
<https://dev.docs.pyansys.com>`_ and implements style checking using
`pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_.

To ensure your code meets minimum code styling standards, run this code::

  pip install pre-commit
  pre-commit run --all-files


You can also install this as a pre-commit hook by running this code::

  pre-commit install

This way, it's not possible for you to push code that fails the style checks::

  $ pre-commit install
  $ git commit -am "added my cool feature"
