Introduction
-------------
Ansys optiSLang is a constantly evolving, leading-edge answer to the challenges posed 
by CAE-based Robust Design Optimization (RDO). Its state-of-the-art algorithms efficiently 
and automatically search for the most robust design configuration, eliminating the slow, 
manual process that used to define RDO.

What is PyOptiSLang?
--------------------
PyOptiSLang is part of the larger `PyAnsys <https://docs.pyansys.com>`_
effort to facilitate the use of Ansys technologies directly from
Python. PyOptiSLang uses JSON strings to launch or connect with running optiSLang process as 
a server. This allows to call methods on a potentially remote optiSLang instance as if it where
a local object. User needs to interact only with Python interface however. You can use PyOptiSLang 
to programmatically create, interact with, and control an optiSLang project, create customizable 
scripts that will speed-up and automate simulations.

Features
--------
Package ``ansys-optislang-core`` provides:
   - Launching of optiSLang locally.
   - Remote connections to optiSLang.
   - Basic server commands, queries and running of python scripts.
